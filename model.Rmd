# quantile regression (a starting attempt)

# Notes from Marianthi OH (3/23/21):

## Either assume continuous outcome for mixed quantile regression; or try rq.counts to have quasipoisson without random intercept (underestimating confidence interval)

# discuss limitation regardless; maybe try both!

# look at distribution of counts; if it "looks normal", maybe use lqmm and assume continuous outcome but if not this will be bad

# look at outcome distribution
hist(full_data$asthma_counts) # severely right skewed, try rq.counts first
