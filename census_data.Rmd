                           )

household_income = get_acs(geography = "county",
                           variables = "B19013_001",
                           state = "CA"
                           )
household_income %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, y = reorder(NAME, estimate))) + 
  geom_point()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
